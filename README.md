This is a simple webpage used to illustrate the ease at which a malicious
website can gather information from a user without their knowledge. Hidden
form fields are auto populated by autocomplete. The form field to get a phone
number is hidden off the page, but it fills with the autocomplete of the
name or email address.
This data could then be sent to a website to be used against the victim.
